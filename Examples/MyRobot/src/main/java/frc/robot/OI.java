  //// CREATING BUTTONS
  // One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a
  //// joystick.
  // You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
  // number it is.
  // Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
  // Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);

  // There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
  // by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
  // commands the same as any other Button.

  //// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
  // Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
  // three ways:

  // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
  // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
  // button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

  // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
  // the button is released.
  // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

  // Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
  // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
  // button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());

  //Declare Buttons
  public Joystick m_joystick; //This is public for reasons we will get to later

  private JoystickButton m_runMotorButton;
  private JoystickButton m_stopMotorButton;

  //Initialize Button to Command
  public OI() {
    m_joystick = new Joystick(RobotMap.joystickUSBID);

    m_runMotorButton = new JoystickButton(m_joystick, 1); //Button A
    m_stopMotorButton = new JoystickButton(m_joystick, 2); //Button B

    //Button A will cause motor to run, Button B will cause motor to stop
    m_runMotorButton.whenPressed(new MyCommand(1));
    m_stopMotorButton.whenPressed(new MyCommand(0));
  }
